## Iranian authorities plan to use facial recognition to enforce new hijab law

On the 16th of September, 2022 Mahsa Amini’s death was about to send shockwaves throughout the world. This young lady was killed by Iran’s moral police for not wearing her hijab properly, and was the source of a wave of protestations against the country’s extremely strict religious rules, most often directed against women, who suffer increasing violations of their fundamental rights. In a new move to control the population, Iran’s authoritarian regime is planning to install facial recognition in public transports to ensure that all women respect the strict clothing rules enforced since Iran’s revolution in 1972. This is of course a terrible violation of personal freedom and democracy, creating growing fears of the country spiralling into true dictatorship.

## Xi Jinping Has Critics in China. They Have Paid a Steep Price.

The 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party took place on the 16th October and the confirmation of Xi-Jiping’s third mandate as the president of the People’s Republic of China didn’t come as a surprise- many analysts criticize this congress as a “mock” congress and a fraud, in  a context of general repression due to the country’s “zero covid” policy and the extreme efforts the party is making to avoid “social instability” surrounding the congress. Indeed, as this article shows, it is becoming more and more dangerous for political critics or opponents to raise their voices; and even though a good part of the population seems to be generally unhappy about the situation they are kept in, criticism is harshly silenced. Reports and evidence of bad treatments, unfair condemnations and even frequent human rights violations are being issued regularly, but the strict control the party holds over its population and its weight in international trade and relations is making it difficult to change the situation.  Democracy is in deep danger in China, and things must change !

## Brazil protests: Lula vows to punish ‘neo-fascists’ after Bolsonaro supporters storm congress

Democracy has a longer history of failures and contestation in Brazil. Today, it still seems to hold a fragile place in the public space, a danger reawakened by the recent election of president Lula, a veteran leftist elected for the second time and who officially took his function on the 1st of January 2023. His main extreme-right opponent, Bolsonaro, who is the former president, has often faced criticism from human rights and democracy defenders. His supporters have stormed congress and several other democratic institutions, in a failed attempt to overthrow his week-old government, a move that was immediately compared to the 6 January invasion of the US Capitol by followers of Donald Trump in 2021.

## Afghanistan professor on girls' education: 'Even if they kill me, I won't stay silent'

The 15th of August 2021, Kabul fell to the hands of the Taliban, who apply a very strict interpretation of the Sharia (the islamic law). In this light, they announced in March 2022 that they would ban all girls’ access to higher education, cutting off the hopes of over three million girls to go to highschool and eventually find a job. Professor Mashal, who runs a private university in Afghanistan’s capital city, cannot stay silent on this issue, and raises in this article his deep concern for the women of the country.

## Ales Bialiatski: Nobel Prize-winning activist sentenced to 10 years in jail

The Belarusian regime of president Alexander Lukashenko has long been criticised for its authoritarian characteristics and has a history of silencing opponents. One of these, Ales Bialiatski, is a prominent Belarusian human rights activist who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize this year for “devoting his life to promoting democracy and peaceful development in his home country" said the head of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. After being arrested and detained without trial for over a year, he has been sentenced for ten years in jail, a decision that has been immediately criticised by his allies and people around the world, accusing Belarus of trying to silence any opposition.

## Tunisia: Is democracy there being destroyed?

Tunisia is the only country which overthrew an authoritarian ruler during the 2011 Arab Spring and went on to build a democracy.

## Sudan’s outsider: how a paramilitary leader fell out with the army and plunged the country into war

Sudan’s leader, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the head of the Sudanese army, and the country’s deputy leader, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (known as Hemedti) had been sharing power since late 2021, when they had jointly carried out a coup that had ejected civilians from a transitional government.  

The civilians of Sudan have been trying to throw off military rule for decades, but now find themselves caught in the middle of a deadly power struggle between former allies turned bitter opponents.

Hemedti only appeared on the national political scene four years ago. In that short time, he has drawn the army, and all of Sudan, into an unprecedented confrontation – in which the country’s army, under Burhan, now finds itself at war with a large paramilitary force that it cannot dominate, under a leader that it cannot control. How did Hemedti, seemingly overnight, come to capture Sudan’s politics?
