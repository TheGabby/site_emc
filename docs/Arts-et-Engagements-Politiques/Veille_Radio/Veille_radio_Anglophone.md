## From Dictatorship to Democracy: The oppressive regime of the dictator Ferdinand Marcos. 14/2/2006

The Philippines have been the siege of an unprecedented feat in the history of democracies, shining light on the power a united population can hold. Under the authoritarian regime of Ferdinand Marcos, from his presidency (1965-86) to the proclamation of his martial rule (1972-81), the country suffered from corruption and violence. The social unrest that resulted from it, led to the population's uprising, uniting all classes, under the hate for the Marcos regime. 

This podcast tells the genuinely unbelievable and extraordinary story of how the Philippines managed to become, once again, a democracy, through non-violent protests with no bloodshed.

## Black History Month : Black Britain and Beyond 17/10/2022

The first celebration of Black History Month took place in 1987 thanks to the fight of Black people and the democratisation of Britain ; today it has become a cultural landmark. In this podcast, the historians Miranda Kauffman and Peter Frankopan, the British Nigerian poet Yomi Sode and the curator Christine Checinska, have each come to discuss the evolution of Black history in Britain, its representation and its repudiation. 

According to Frankopan, global history can be defined by trying to fill in the gaps of the forgotten, or the ignored. To look at the connections, how the world has been put together, and the big themes that are the quintessential materials for history to exist (i.e. poverty, climate, disease, etc). From roman times to this day, these experts will illustrate Black British history through their works and experiences.

## Start The Week : Marwa Al-Sabouni - Rebuilding with hope

This podcast covers the importance of reconstruction and architecture, notably in post-war and destruction sites, an aspect that is often forgotten. They have a significant role in creating hope for a better city or country, notably as democracies.

Indeed, through the city’s architecture, one can understand a certain amount of things in how it is organised, its priorities, etc. Rebuilding a city is a lot more complex than just finding the money to finance it. One has to consider the will of those for whom it is being rebuilt, not simply the big gestures (museums, main roads), but the small things that help the communities, such as lights, wide pavements, etc. Do they want to go back to what they once had, or do they want something different? 

Infrastructures and design are highly symbolic and essential as they enable and can prompt changes in a city. It can help liberalise and pave the way to a more just society, that is better adapted to the needs of people who have been struck by disaster.

## Arts & Ideas ; Hannah Arendt’s exploration of Totalitarianism

Hannah Arendt's works are a source of vivid controversy and admiration. The Origins of Totalitarianism (1951), one of her most influential books, presents an interesting point of view on the sociopolitical context of her time ; imperialism, anti-semitism, totalitarianism, democracies etc. 

In this podcast, the prominent figure of Arendt is discussed by people from the right and the left political spectrum, as well as various authors. As a Jewish refugee and naturalised American, she explores the roots from which totalitarian regimes emerge from, how they are implemented, what threats they pose. As the sales of her works have suddenly picked up in speed, one might want to see how their meaning or the criticism associated with them, might come into context in current affairs.

## Democracy Paradox : Olga Onuch and Henry Hale Describe the Zelensky Effect. 

As Russia and Ukraine are still at war with each other, one might find it interesting to delve a little deeper into what we know about the leaders of these countries.

In this podcast, Olga Onuch and Henry Hale discuss the Zelensky Effect, and as such, to what extent Volodymyr Zelensky has changed Ukraine. Another angle under which this statement can be examined, is through the analysis of Ukraine as a people, and how Zelensky - and his accomplishments - are a product of this society. 

Is the face of Ukraine’s war - a symbol of resilience and hope - bringing changes to the Ukrainian democracy, the result of his own input or that of the general public opinion that he managed to tap into, and amplify?
